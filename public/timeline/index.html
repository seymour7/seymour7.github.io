        This project explored the design and implementation of a mobile application for South African Sign Language recognition. The application connects, via Bluetooth, to an instrumented glove in development by the University of Cape Town. The objective is to recognise the manual alphabet and manual numeric digits that have static gestures (31 signs in total). This project was split into two primary tasks: designing the classification model and designing the mobile application. Two neural networks (one with a log-sigmoid, and one with a symmetric Elliott activation function) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) were compared. The SVM was chosen for implementation primarily because of its high accuracy of 99% and its superior robustness. However, multiple problems were encountered when attempting to automatically detect isolated gestures in a continuous stream of data. The mobile application was developed for Android and allowed the user to connect to a Bluetooth glove, display and dictate the classification output and calibrate the connected glove. It was predominately successful in real-time classification of the gestures within the restrictions of the smartphone's resources. On a low-end smartphone, the classification time did not exceed 45ms, the memory usage did not exceed 15 MB, and the battery life during typical usage was approximately 11 hours.

        Convos pairs random UCT students, anonymously, in a chat window using UCT user/pass authentication. My most challenging project to date due to message synchronisation and the real-time requirements of the app. I developed it using PHP, MySQL and JavaScript (using JQuery). Required socket programming (for HTML5 websockets). On day 1 of release, 40 users logged in, but was blocked shortly thereafter by UCT for security reasons (I was using libcurl and the Vula login page to authenticate users).

        I made 2 multiplayer games using the canvas tag and websockets: pong and go (a Chinese board game). I was really excited with the possibilities that websockets could provide, that ajax could not. Despite chrome only properly supporting websockets, I went about with the development. Nowadays, all browsers support websockets. I never released either of these games to the public as I didn't finish them well enough (due to university work and lack of momentum).

        With increasing support by browsers for HTML5 and CSS3, 2 features caught my attention: websockets and the canvas tag. I decided to explore the canvas tag by making a small replica of the old 2D platform game, Worms. I didn't get very far, but managed to get a good idea of how the canvas tag works.

        I made an IRC Bot using Python 2.6 for the purpose of retrieving information from a local gaming server, for the game <em>BaboViolent 2</em>, and displaying it in an IRC channel. It was originally called 'sarah' and that is why you see the name popping up in the source code a few times. The biggest feature of the bot is retrieving in-game chat by using sockets to retrieve the raw data from the game server and regex to separate the chat from the other data. You can view the source here: http://pastebin.com/Tv7BvKUr. On the right is a screenshot of the bot in action.

      <p>
        Here's another IRC Bot I made in PHP, quite a while before the Python bot and thus it is a lot simpler. I had fun making it though as it was the first time I interacted with another protocol (IRC) in a script. Afterwards, I realized Python would be much better to use for an IRC bot.

        Capped.co.za (name chosen because I already owned the domain from a prior project) was an image host (similar to <a href="http://imgur.com/">imgur</a>) that did not require a database. I built it using an MVC, PHP framework, <em>CodeIgniter</em>. It was implemented without the use of a database (for web hosting reasons), and hence, relied heavily on its file structure and names. The site made use of ImageMagick for image manipulation and had about 400 image uploads before I took it down.

        In 2008 I decided to make an Afrikaans dictionary so that I could instantly translate Afrikaans words into English and vice versa. However, after looking at the size of my school dictionary, I realized it would take me years to manually add each word. My next idea was to make the website community based and allow users to submit words with their translations and also allow the people that use the dictionary to remove spam/wrong words by voting the translations up or down. I made the site using PHP, XHTML, CSS, Javascript (for asynchronous rating of words/spam reporting) and MySQL for the database of all the words. I tried to keep the site as simple as possible. You can search for translations on the homepage, add translations on the translate page and browse words from a-z on the browse page. I never released the site because of hosting costs.

        Up until this point in my life, almost all my time on a computer was spent playing games. I can't quite recall what my motivation was, but in 2005 I began doing more constructive things (which felt like quite a natural transition). Me and my friend, Tim, began game development using a drag-and-drop application, GameMaker 5. To get more advanced control of the game's design, however, you'd need to make use of the Game Maker Language (GML), a scripting language with similar syntax to c++. This is when I first started learning to code, which was a slow process where I'd read examples and use trial-and-error. I still remember the day Tim and I learnt what a "variable" was - it was quite eye-opening (and remember, this was before we even did algebra in high school).
      </p>
      <p>
        We developed many games, but one in particular got the most attention: CubeVoid. It's similar to the game, Copter, but with added features like powerups, boss levels, variations in physical properties, etc. We'd bring new versions of the game to school and play it with our friends during lunch.
