The discipline of Project Management is understood to be:
a. A new management paradigm that seeks to create common tools and techniques that can be used in all instances where management is required.
b. The application of knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to project activities to meet project requirements.
c. Another way that traditional business can be managed on an ongoing basis, but in a way to realise improved operational efficiencies.
d. An extension of traditional business processes that is invoked at times when the business faces specific environmental challenges.

A project is thus defined as:
a. A repetitive set of actions organised and integrated in a manner that produces a consistent result over and over again.
b. A unique endeavour undertaken to produce a temporary product or service.
c. A temporary endeavour undertaken to produce a unique product or service.
d. One of the components present within the normal day to day operation of a going concern.

Given what has been defined as a project in class, select from the following, which should not be classified as a project.
a. The preparation of the Cape Town International Convention Centre to host the 2008 International Mining and Exploration Conference.
b. The day to day operation Cape Town International Convention Centre.
c. The development of a new mine for mining of the mineral sands in ecologically sensitive areas of northern Kwa-Zulu Natal.
d. The extension of the Richards Bay ore terminal to accommodate additional exports of mineral sand products.

The 3 phase project life cycle starts with the initiating phase and ends with the closing phase. What is the middle phase?
a. The operating phase.
b. The planning phase.
c. The controlling phase.
d. The implementing phase.

The 3, 4 and 5 phase project life cycles all have an initiating phase. The initiating phase is:
a. The stage of the project where the project idea is conceived for any of several reasons, the idea is developed to the point where it can be tested and motivated and ends with seeking approval to proceed to the next phase.
b. The stage of the project where the project has already been approved but where there is so little information that a project team need to be pulled together to develop project specifications so that costs can be determined.
c. The stage of the project where the costs are already known, the team is already assembled and the costs have been firmed up but the client is not quite convinced. The project team spends time convincing the client.
d. The stage of the project where no-one really knows what to do and the main activity of the project team is to probe and test different angles in developing a project strategy for a project that is going to happen in any case.

Name phase 3 of the 4 phase project life cycle.
a. Planning phase;
b. Close out phase;
c. Operational and maintenance phase;
d. None of the above.

Scope management includes all the processes required to ensure that the project includes all the work and only the work required to complete the project successfully. In the class notes we discuss the management of project scope in terms of 5 distinct processes. Scope initiation, scope planning, scope definition, scope verification and scope change control. In this context, does Scope Initiation mean?
a. The first level of the Work Breakdown Structure?
b. The first outcome of the project life cycle and the signal to start the planning stage?
c. The process of obtaining the client commitment to begin with the next phase of the project?
d. Nothing at all?

A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is defined as a results oriented family tree that captures the entire scope of as project in an organised way. Does the 100% rule then include?
a. “100% of the work defined by the project scope and captures all deliverables – internal, external and interim – in terms of the work to be completed, excluding project management.”
b. “100% of the work defined by the project scope and captures all deliverables – internal, external and interim – in terms of the work to be completed, including project management.”
c. “100% of the project activities only in an organised way including internal, external and project management – in terms of the work to be completed.”
d. “100% of the project activities and deliverables as well as any other activities and deliverables that could possibly be required, in an organised way including internal, external and project management – in terms of the work to be completed.”

One of the following statements is not true of WBS. Mark the incorrect statement.
a) A WBS is not an exhaustive list of activities. It is instead a comprehensive classification of the project scope.
b) A WBS is not a project plan or a project schedule and it is not a chronological listing.
c) It is acceptable and encouraged to construct a project schedule (e.g. a precedent network) before completing a WBS.
d) WBS is not representative of the organisational hierarchy.

Time management by definition:
a) Means that the project manager needs to manage himself and is only responsible to see to it that he delivers on the dates promised.
b) Includes all processes required to ensure that all processes (and hence the project) is completed in a timely manner.
c) Means that the project manager needs to monitor project performance from a time perspective and merely reports on the project\'s time performance.
d) Includes all processes required to ensure that the project is completed within the correct time, under budget and to the exacting quality.

Which one of the following statements is not true in the context of cost management?
a) Analogous estimating and parametric modelling are two techniques used to develop order of magnitude (or high level) cost estimates.
b) Cost estimates and pricing are essentially the same things.
c) Cost estimates are quantitative assessments of the likely cost of resources required to complete all project activities.
d) The WBS is also used to organise the cost estimates and to ensure that all identified work is included in the cost estimate.
